# face_recognition

This is a face recognition project that uses OpenCV and machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams. The project includes two Python scripts: one to create a dataset for face recognition, one to train a face recognition model on a dataset of faces, and a real-time face recognition application that can detect and recognize faces in video streams or images.
