# face_recognition

This is a face recognition project that uses OpenCV and machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams. The project includes three Python scripts: one to create a dataset for face recognition, one to train a face recognition model on a dataset of faces, and a real-time face recognition application that can detect and recognize faces in video streams or images. 




# Installation

To use this project, you'll need to install OpenCV and Python 3 on your system. You can install OpenCV using pip:

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python

```

You'll also need to install the following Python packages:

```
pip install numpy

```

# Usage

To use the face recognition script, you'll need to prepare a dataset of faces that the model can be trained on. The dataset should be organized in the following format:

```
dataset/
    person1/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    person2/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    ...
```
